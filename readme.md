A high performant data table for Preact.

## WIP

This is a prototype being shaped into a library. Core functionality and performance were tested in RND phase, now the goal is to make it usable.

```sh
deno run dev
```

## Project structure

There's no `src` or extra build setup. Deno and Vite handle it seamlessly 
so we can use a `flat` project structure inspired by go. A directory is a module, root is a package.
